A new attempt at a roguelike, with a focus on time mechanics.

The idea is to reuse the time mechanic from GDD but make it more proeminent.

To make this actually feasible to do in the next few months, I won't be able to do as many things however.

Hmm.
What if I made it 2d platformer?
The physics might be hard to implement, but the result might be epic
A sort of turn-based platformer fighting game.

You'd be a square that could shoot, walk, and jump
Maybe shooting would imbue a change in momentum for added leet tricks

Okay so, all movement is in one of two forms
Right-click: thrust in the direction of the mouse; very effective at imbuing movement, but only works when grounded.
Left-click: shoot in the direction of the mouse. Has a cooldown, perhaps varying with weapon. Knocks the user back in the opposite direction.

The most basic of enemies could perhaps be a simple thrust-at-the-player type, dealing damage when touches them. Just implement these ones for now.

Add, furthermore, power ups for a matrix like experience, slowing down time substancially for a little, allowing rekkage

Reminder: add replays
and a trail so, while the game is paused, you can still see the velocity of the dudes
